## Contributing
If you’ve already understood about the project, here is how you can take action.

### Create an Issue
* If
    - You find a bug in this project.
    - Want to increase its tests coverage.
    - Have trouble following the documentation.
    - Have a question about the project.
    - Want to make it better.
* Then
    - create an issue!

### Issues Pro Tips
* **Check existing issues** for your issue. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re running into has been addressed already.
* **Be clear** about what your problem is.
    - What was the expected outcome, what happened instead? Detail how someone else can recreate the problem.
* **Link to demos** recreating the problem on things like PHPFiddle, JSFiddle or CodePen.
* **Paste error output** or logs in your issue or in a Gist.
    - If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks: ` ``` ` so that it renders nicely.
* Try to follow issues [tips from github](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

### Pull Request Pro Tips
* Clone it locally.
* **Create a branch** for your edits.
* **Be clear** about what problem is occurring and how someone can recreate that problem or why your feature will help. Then be equally as clear about the steps you took to make your changes.
* **Test test test**. Run your changes against any existing tests if they exist and create new ones when needed. Whether tests exist or not, make sure your changes don’t break the existing project.
* **Include screenshots** of the before and after if your changes include differences in HTML/CSS. Drag and drop the images into the body of your pull request.
* **Contribute in the style of the project** to the best of your abilities. This may mean using indents, semi colons or comments differently than you would in your own repository, but makes it easier for the maintainer to merge, others to understand and maintain in the future.

### Open Pull Requests
* Once you’ve opened a pull request a discussion will start around your proposed changes.
* Other contributors and users may chime in, but ultimately the decision is made by the maintainer(s).
* You may be asked to make some changes to your pull request, if so, add more commits to your branch and push them – they’ll automatically go into the existing pull request.
